# Breast-Cancer-Classification-using-PyTorch


This project demonstrates how to build and train a deep neural network using the PyTorch library for classifying breast cancer diagnoses based on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset. The model is trained to distinguish between malignant and benign tumors using supervised learning.

Features
âœ… Implemented a fully connected neural network for classification
âœ… Used CrossEntropyLoss and Adam optimizer for training
âœ… Tracked model performance with training and test loss curves
âœ… Achieved a final test loss of ~0.4, indicating strong generalization
âœ… Visualized model convergence through loss plots

Results
ðŸ“‰ Loss Reduction: Both training and test losses consistently decrease, indicating effective learning.
ðŸ“Š Stable Generalization: The final loss values suggest minimal overfitting, making the model reliable for new data.

Future Enhancements
ðŸ”¹ Hyperparameter tuning for better performance
ðŸ”¹ Regularization techniques (dropout, batch normalization)
ðŸ”¹ Experimenting with deeper architectures
